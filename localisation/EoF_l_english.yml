GRF_border_war.3.t:0 "Our Forces Repelled"
GRF_border_war.3.desc:0 "Our initial attack failed to break through the Equestrian defences. Despite several subsquent attacks, increasing Equestrian reinforcements make it infeasible to continue with this operation."

EoF.4.desc:0 "Stalliongrad has offered us a deal to secure their entry into the UPA. If we return their claimed border territory and give them access to several strategic islands, they would be willing to join our alliance. While the current situation behooves us to accept their proposal, perhaps we should send a counteroffer that does not require us transfer as much territory."

EoF.5.t:0 "Request Nova Griffonian Assistance"
EoF.5.desc:0 "While our army is more than capable of handing the pathetic Penguins alone, the approach to Amundsen is devoid of infrastructure as well as bordered by both mountains and sea.

EoF.5.a:0 "Send the request."

EoF.6.t:0 "Joint Military Operation With the Polar Bears"

EoF_great_war.2.desc:0 "The premier question facing our high command at this moment is whether to attack immediately or wait until winter is over to launch our offensive.
